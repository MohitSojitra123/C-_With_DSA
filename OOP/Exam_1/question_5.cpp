// Q5. Inheritance and Ambiguity Resolution (10 marks)
// Input-Output Explanation:
// ● Input: Create a hierarchy with base and derived classes. Input data relevant to the
// classes (e.g., student details in one class and teacher details in another).
// ● Output: The program will show single and multiple inheritance in action. For multiple
// inheritance, ambiguity will be resolved using the membership label operator, ensuring
// correct attribute or method access.
