// Q7. Data Abstraction and Abstract Classes (20 marks)
// 1. Create an abstract base class Employee with the following:
// ○ A pure virtual function calculateSalary() and a normal function
// displayDetails().
// 2. Create two derived classes FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee that
// override the calculateSalary()method.
// ○ Input and display employee details like name, hours worked, and salary.
// 3. Use different access modifiers (public, private, and protected) in inheritance to
// demonstrate access control in the derived classes.
// Explanation:
// Input:
// ● Define attributes for Employee (e.g., name, employee ID) and specific attributes for
// derived classes (e.g., hoursWorked for PartTimeEmployee or monthlySalary for
// FullTimeEmployee). Input these values during runtime.
// Output:
// ● Display the name, ID, and calculated salary of each employee using the overridden
// calculateSalary() function.
// ● Demonstrate abstraction by preventing direct instantiation of the Employee class
// (abstract class).
// ● Show access control in action by attempting to access attributes/methods with different
// modifiers (public, protected, private) from derived and external classes.
